# Inventory-Management-System-ETG
This is an inventory management system for managing products. I have created this system on a NoSQL database.

1. I have used JSON file system for the same.
2. New inventories can be added.
3. Purchase can be made.
4. Sales can be updated.

We have added five features:
1. Product id
2. Name of product
3. Price
4. Quantity
5. GST Rate

My system can perform the following actions:
1. Generate bills
2. Update inventory 
3. Purchase of items
4. Adding items to inventory
